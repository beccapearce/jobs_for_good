# Description
 A website to help those looking for jobs in companies that pride themselves on social impact

While searching for jobs myself I decided to make the page I really wanted to exist

### Instructions

Until it is deployed and everyone is using it, run locally

clone the code

migrate the database with ```bin/rake db:migrate```

run with ```rails s```

and go to ```localhost/3000```

then marvel at all the CSS I haven't yet done!
